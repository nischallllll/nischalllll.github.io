        Why bother going to grad school??? One should be able to come up with their own list of reasons to attend a
        grad
        school, for sure. I think the common denominator is that you want to do something new and non-trivial that has
        not been done before.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>But what is new? And how different or how big is it going to be from what the field has already seen?</em>
        These questions and answers very much depend on your personal temperament, taste, and appetite for
        ambition/risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's go over some of the cost-benefits of choosing graduate study. <li>
          1. <strong>TIME COMMITTMENT</strong>: >5 years. And this is during most youthful years of your life. Income?
          Work-life
          balance? Relationships?
          You might have to
          compromise on these things. Do you want that? <br>
          2. Failures: it's exciting to study the previously uncharacterized problems, but there are reasons why they
          are
          long-standing problems.
          It is entirely not surprising to be at your fourth year and the problem still remains unsolved. Or somebody
          else
          scooped you and ge their name on it.<br>
          3. Competitive field, limited resources.<br>
          4. You will get a chace to extensively focus on a specific topic for an extended period of time. This is a
          huge
          plus if you're inclided, intellectually, to
          know the unknown and controbute to the field.
        </li>

      <p> <strong> Things to consider while deciding to go to grad school</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <strong>- location</strong>: Read essay by Paul Graham on <a
          href="https://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html">Cities and
          Ambition</a>
        you might be initially just drawn to general cityscape--parks, museums, restarants, etc. but the truth is
        cities
        has its own style of its own.
        each field has couple of cities where there are lots of academics and industries clamped together.
        in such place, you can expect to bump into people who have the same interests as you, or even who have already
        achieved what you want to achieve. being in such place helps in the long-term, for sure.
        <br>

        <strong>- field</strong>: it's true that some fields are more 'hot', at a given moment, than others. it's even
        tragic that
        most of the funding and citations go to such set of fields. you have to be able to decide noise from signal,
        but
        the reputation of a field matters a lot. if it attracts lots of attention, talent, and has a decent future,
        it probably has a solid problem that need to be solved. it's worth to put you in such a situation where you
        surround
        yourself with talented people, resources, and a solid future.
        <br>


        <strong>- PI</strong>: the lab, its past record, the style of advisement, the overall culture, etc.
        the lab you join matters a lot, but you should not be limited by it. you should be able
        to move beyond it--both apropos of menteroship and research directions. that being said,
        it's mostly shaped by the PI and the lab culture. try to peek into the lab culture and gauze as much as you
        can
        before committing to it. also you want to make sure, there are at least 2-3 PIs in the instituion that you
        join whose work
        you are interested in. things can always go wrong with your primary mentor. <em>it's good to have a safety
          net.
          always err on the side of options (larger variance of opportunities).</em>


      </ul>
