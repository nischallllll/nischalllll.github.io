        Why bother going to grad school??? One should be able to come up with their own list of reasons to attend a
        grad
        school, for sure. I think the common denominator is that you want to do something new and non-trivial that has
        not been done before.

      <p>
        <em>But what is new? And how different or how big is it going to be from what the field has already seen?</em>
        These questions and answers very much depend on your personal temperament, taste, and appetite for
        ambition/risk.
