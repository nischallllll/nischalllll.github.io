PRESENTATION:
  description: |
    I am a Computational Biologist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory working in Dr. Peter Westcott's Laboratory. My research focuses on understanding the genomic basis of cancer through advanced computational approaches and cutting-edge sequencing technologies.

    My work centers on cancer genomics and disease heterogeneity, where I leverage diverse bioinformatics pipelines to dissect the transcriptomic and cellular factors driving disease progression.

    By integrating high-resolution genomic data with robust computational analysis, I aim to uncover the governing principles of human diseases, identify novel therapeutic targets, contribute to precision medicine approaches, and develop computational tools for genomic analysis.
