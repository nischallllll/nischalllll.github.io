# CV File Instructions

To add your CV PDF from Overleaf:

1. Export your CV as a PDF from Overleaf
2. Save the PDF file as `cv.pdf` in this directory (`config/assets/`)
3. The CV will automatically appear as a preview on your portfolio with a download button

## What visitors will see:
- **PDF Preview**: Your CV will be displayed directly on the page in an embedded viewer
- **Download Button**: A button to download the PDF for offline viewing
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, modern styling that matches your portfolio theme

## Configuration Options:
You can customize the CV section in `config/resume.yml`:
- `show_preview: true/false` - Enable/disable the PDF preview
- `preview_height: "800px"` - Adjust the height of the preview
- `title`, `description`, `button_text` - Customize the text

Make sure the PDF file is named exactly `cv.pdf` and placed in this directory.
